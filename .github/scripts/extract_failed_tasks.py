"""Extracts the Gradle tasks that failed from a GitHub Actions job log.

Reads a job log on stdin and prints one task path per line, deduplicated, in the
order they appear.

Prints nothing when no Gradle task failed. A job can fail without one, as
happens when a dependency repository returns HTTP 429 or a runner step dies
before Gradle starts.

Exit codes:
  0 - success, including when no failing task is present
