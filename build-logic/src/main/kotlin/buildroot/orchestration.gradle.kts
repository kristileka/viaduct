/**
 * Orchestration plugin for BOTH the top-level root and any included build roots.
 *
 * In ANY build it’s applied to:
 *   - Creates local subproject aggregates (no cycles with root tasks):
 *       :orchestrationBuildAll         -> all subprojects' `build`
 *       :orchestrationCheckAll         -> all subprojects' `check`
 *       :orchestrationCleanAll         -> all subprojects' `clean`
 *       :orchestrationTestAll          -> all subprojects' `Test` tasks
 *       :orchestrationPublishAllToMavenLocal
 *       :orchestrationPublishAllToMavenCentral
 *   - In INCLUDED BUILDS (gradle.parent != null), exposes conventional task names that
 *     delegate to the aggregates: `build`, `check`, `clean`, `test`, `publishToMavenLocal`, `publishToMavenCentral`.
 *
 * In the TOP-LEVEL ROOT ONLY (gradle.parent == null):
 *   - Adds repo-wide tasks spanning root subprojects + selected included builds’ aggregates:
 *       build, check, clean, test, detekt, ktlintCheck, spotlessCheck, dokka, jacoco, ci
 *       publishToMavenLocal, publishToMavenCentral
 *
 * Root configuration:
 *   orchestration {
 *     participatingIncludedBuilds.set(listOf("core", "gradle-plugins"))
 *   }
