/**
 * Thread-safe data structure for memoizing field resolution results during GraphQL query execution.
 * See [Cell] for more about thread safety guarantees.
 *
 * It is designed to handle the following GraphQL execution patterns:
 *
 * 1. Multiple resolvers may attempt to resolve the same field concurrently
 * 2. Resolvers may request field values before they are computed
 * 3. Field values, once set, are immutable
 *
 * The [ObjectEngineResultImpl] has a "lazy resolution state". It can start in either a complete or incomplete state,
 * represented using a [Deferred] value.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * // Writer:
 * ```
 * val result = engine.computeIfAbsent(key) { slotSetter ->
 *     slotSetter.setRaw(computeValue())
 *     slotSetter.setAccessCheck(computeAccessCheckValue())
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * // Reader:
 * val value = engine.fetch(key, ACCESS_CHECK_SLOT) // Suspends if value not yet available
 * ```
 *
 * @see fetch For reading values
 * @see computeIfAbsent For the combined claim/compute/complete operation

     * The engine supports unresolved lazy references (e.g. for nodes and root fields).
     * When a resolver returns a lazy reference, we "optimistically" allocate an OER for it to
     * store any already-resolved data (e.g. node id) and to indicate that it's pending resolution.
     *
     * During resolution the pending resolver is called in parallel with field-resolvers on that
     * object, meaning fields of this this OER might get filled out with values even though,
     * eventually, if the pending resolver fails, we're going to discard those results and treat
     * the entire field containing the OER as failed.
     *
     * A key observation here is that during resolution, it's okay to treat the OER as if it's
     * going to be successful (we're "optimistic" during resolution). However, during completion,
     * if the pending resolver has failed, we need to treat the field containing the OER as if it
     * failed (and discard any results we optimistically resolved).
     *
     * To implement these semantics, OERs have a property called [lazyResolutionState], which is a CompletableDeferred.
     * While [lazyResolutionState] is uncompleted, we say that the OER is "pending", which means its in its "optimistic"
     * phase and fetches of its fields return normally. However, once the node resolver returns,
     * [lazyResolutionState] is completed to one of three states:
     * - [LazyResolutionResult.VALUE]: resolution succeeded and the OER contains valid data
     * - [LazyResolutionResult.NULL]: resolution succeeded and this object resolved to null. This OER should be discarded
     *      during completion.
     * - Exceptionally: resolution failed (fetches of the OER's fields will fail)
