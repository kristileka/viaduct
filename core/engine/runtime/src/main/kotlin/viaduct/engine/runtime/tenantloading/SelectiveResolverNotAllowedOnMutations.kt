/**
 * Rejects `@resolver(isSelective: true)` on mutation fields.
 *
 * A selective resolver may re-execute when additional fields are requested, which for a
 * mutation would re-run its side effects. Mutation fields live either on the root mutation
 * type or on a `@namespaceType` object reachable from it; both are guarded here.
 *
 * This is the engine-layer backstop for the codegen-time ban: it covers every authoring path
 * (Kotlin codegen, Java tenant API, and programmatically-built executors), because all executors
 * flow through tenant-load validation regardless of how they were produced.
