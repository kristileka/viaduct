 * Stable string identifiers attached to every schema-scoping configuration error surfaced to the

 * codebase (see `viaduct.graphql.schema.validation.ValidationErrorCodes`).
 *
 * Codes appear in build output as `[CODE] message`. They are part of the user-facing contract:
 * downstream tooling and tests may match on them, so once published a code may be reworded but
 * should not be renamed without a deprecation cycle.
