 * Declared here because it is part of [ExecutionRegistryConfigFile]'s wire format and because engine
 * code legitimately needs to recognize its own default API at runtime (see
 * `RemoteResolverSelection`). It is *not* a registry of every tenant API: `apiName` is deliberately an
 * open string so any other tenant API — including ones built outside this engine — declares its own
 * name in its own module. Do not add names here.
 *
 * Producers that do not depend on this module mirror this literal instead: the `api_name` attr default
 * in the Bazel rule, and the Gradle plugin/build-logic constants — the latter can depend on this module
 * now and should be pointed here.
