     * the current type is an interface.
     *
     * **Examples**
     *

     * ```
     *   interface Node { id: ID! }
     *   type Foo implements Node { id: ID! }

     * on a type that is the same or narrower than the supplied type, or that this
     * SelectionSet includes an inline fragment or fragment spread with a type condition
     * that is the same or narrower than the supplied type.
     *
     * If a type is *requested*, it is safe to conclude that the GraphQL client that created
     * this SelectionSet knows how to handle the supplied type.
     *
     * **GraphQL Object Type Examples**
     *
     * Given this type definition:
     * ```
     *   type Foo { id: ID! }
     * ```
     * Then `requestsType(Foo)` will return these values for the provided selections
     * - for selections `id`, returns true because the selection set contains a field
     *   defined by Foo
     * - for selections `... { id }`, returns true because the selection set contains an
     *   inline fragment with an implied type condition on the surrounding type, Foo
     * - for selections `id @skip(if:true)`, returns true because the selection set
     *   itself describes an inline fragment on type Foo, even though the selections are
     *   empty.
     *
     * **GraphQL Union Type Examples**
     *
     * Given these definitions:
     * ```
     *  type Foo { id: ID! }
     *  type Bar { id: ID! }
     *  union FooOrBar = Foo | Bar
     * ```
     * And given these selections on `FooOrBar`:
     * ```
     *   ... on Foo { id }
     * ```
     *
     * Then this method will have the following behavior:
     * - `requestsType(FooOrBar)` returns true because the selections include an
     *   inline fragment on Foo, which is narrower than FooOrBar.
     * - `requestsType(Bar)` returns false because there are no selections with
     *   a type condition on Bar
     *
     * While the above example is based on a union type and its members, the rules
     * apply equally well to an interface and its implementations.

    /**
     * Return a SelectionSet describing the selections at the provided field.
     * If the current SelectionSet does not include the provided field, then an
     * empty SelectionSet will be returned.
     *
     * This method can be used to extract selections for a field belonging to any subtype
     * of the current type. This allows deriving subselections of a field from a union
     * member if the current selections are on a union type, or deriving subselections
     * of an interface implementation if the current selections are on an interface type.
     *
     * **Examples**
     *
     * Given these type definitions:
     * ```
     *   interface Node { id: ID! }
     *   type Foo implements Node { id: ID!, bar: Bar }
     *   type Bar implements Node { id: ID!, foo: Foo }
     * ```

     *       id
     *       foo { id }

     *   }
     *   ... on Foo {
     *     bar { __typename }
     *   }
     * ```
     * Then `selectionSetFor` will have the following behavior:
     * - `selectionSetFor(Foo.bar)` will return a `SelectionSet<Bar>` with a selections for
     *   `id, foo { id }, __typename`, because these are the merged selections for the
     *   Foo.bar field under Node.
     * - `selectionSetFor(Bar.foo)` will return a `SelectionSet<Foo>` that is empty, because
     *   even though Bar.foo is selected somewhere in the SelectionSet, it is not included
     *   in the immediate children of the current selections.
