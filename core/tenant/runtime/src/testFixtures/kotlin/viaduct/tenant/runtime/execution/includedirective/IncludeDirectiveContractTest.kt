/**
 * Contract test for the @include directive.
 *
 * Defines the SDL and assertions for:
 * - @include(if: false) skips field execution entirely
 * - @include(if: true) executes the field normally
 * - @include(if: false) does not call @resolver even if it would throw
 * - @include(if: $variable) with a variable that evaluates to false
 *
 * Extend this class and provide resolver implementations to verify that a given
 * runtime correctly supports these patterns.
