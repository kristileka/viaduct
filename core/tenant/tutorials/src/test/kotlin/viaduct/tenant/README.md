# Viaduct Framework Tutorials

A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial series that teaches you how to build GraphQL APIs with the Viaduct framework. Each tutorial builds on the previous one, taking you from basic concepts to advanced optimization patterns.


## Tutorial Notes

-  Function: createGlobalIdString is a TEST-ONLY utility method provided by KotlinFeatureAppTestContractBase.
-  Function: getInternalId is a TEST-ONLY utility method provided by KotlinFeatureAppTestContractBase.
-  Each test scenario builds a new instance of viaduct.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of GraphQL concepts (queries, mutations, types)
- Familiarity with Kotlin programming language
- Understanding of database and API concepts

## Tutorial Series Overview

This series consists of a set of progressive tutorials, each demonstrating core Viaduct concepts through working code examples and tests. Follow them in order for the best learning experience.

## How to Use the Tutorials

Start with Tutorial 1 and work your way through the series in order. Each tutorial builds on concepts from previous ones.
