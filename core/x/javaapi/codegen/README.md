# Java GRTs Code Generation CLI

This package contains CLI commands for generating Java GraphQL Representational Types (GRTs) from schema files.

## Commands Overview

### JavaGRTsGenerator

Generates **Java source code** for GraphQL types from schema files.

**Key Benefits:**

- Pure Java output for Java-first projects
- Full IDE support (autocomplete, navigation, refactoring)
- Source-level debugging capabilities
- Supports type extensions (`extend enum`, `extend type`, `extend input`, `extend interface`, `extend union`)

## Building

Build the fat JAR with all dependencies:

```bash
./gradlew :core:x:javaapi:codegen:shadowJar
```

The JAR will be created at `x/javaapi/codegen/build/libs/java-grts-codegen-<version>.jar`.

## Usage

```bash
java -jar x/javaapi/codegen/build/libs/java-grts-codegen-<version>.jar \
  --schema_files /path/to/schema.graphqls \
  --grt_output_dir /path/to/generated/grts \
  --grt_package com.mycompany.graphql.types \
  --resolver_generated_dir /path/to/generated/resolvers \
  --tenant_package com.mycompany.tenant \
  --verbose
```

\* Exactly one of `--grt_package` or `--grt_package_file` must be provided.

## Generated Output

### GRT Types

The GRT output directory will contain Java source files organized by package:

```
grt_output_dir/
└── com/
    └── mycompany/
        └── graphql/
            └── types/
                ├── MyEnum.java
                ├── MyObject.java
                ├── MyInput.java
                ├── MyInterface.java
                └── MyUnion.java
```

### Resolver Base Classes

Resolver files are written to package subdirectories under the resolver output directory. The package is `{tenant_package}.resolverbases`:

```
resolver_generated_dir/
└── com/
    └── mycompany/
        └── tenant/
            └── resolverbases/
                ├── UserResolvers.java
                ├── ListingResolvers.java
                └── QueryResolvers.java
```

Each resolver file contains abstract base classes for fields with the `@resolver` directive that tenant developers extend to implement resolvers.

### Selective resolvers are temporarily disabled

Java field and node declarations with `@resolver(isSelective: true)` or the legacy
`@resolver(selective: true)` fail during resolver code generation, including batched resolvers.
The error identifies the field coordinate or node type. Ordinary and batching resolvers with
selectivity omitted or set to `false` remain supported.

The lower-level resolver models, templates, annotations, and selective context interfaces remain
as inactive scaffolding. Their positive generator tests preserve that scaffolding; they do not
indicate that selective execution is supported. Java annotation processing and bootstrap also
reject selective metadata when schema codegen is bypassed. See the
[Java selective-resolver implementation document](../impldocs/selective-resolvers.md) for the
cross-layer inventory and reenable checklist.

## Supported Types

- **Enums** - Including extended enums (`extend enum`)
- **Objects** - GraphQL object types with fields, getters/setters, and builder pattern
- **Inputs** - GraphQL input types with fields, getters/setters, and builder pattern
- **Interfaces** - GraphQL interface types
- **Unions** - GraphQL union types
- **Argument Types** - Java types for field arguments
- **Resolvers** - Abstract base classes for fields with `@resolver` directive

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew :core:x:javaapi:codegen:test
```
