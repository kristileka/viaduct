# Remote Resolver Architecture

Remote resolvers replace selected Viaduct node and field resolver executors with gRPC proxies. The GraphQL engine, query planning, required-selection-set resolution, access checks, and response completion remain in the main server process. Only the tenant resolver executor call moves to a remote resolver server.

This document describes the current experimental implementation in `core/x/remoteresolvers`: bootstrap, resolver dispatch, wire formats, callback execution, process-local state, failure isolation, lifecycle, and test coverage. The module's [README](../README.md) covers configuration and running the StarWars demo.

## Terminology

- **Main server** or **RRP**: The Viaduct process that owns GraphQL execution. It replaces selected executors with `RemoteNodeProxyExecutor` or `RemoteFieldProxyExecutor` and exposes `EngineCallbackService`.
- **Remote server** or **RRS**: The process that owns `RemoteResolverService`, bootstraps tenant executors independently, and invokes them for incoming RPCs.
- **Executor ID**: A stable string used to identify the same logical resolver in both processes. Node executors use their GraphQL type name; field executors use their field coordinate (`Type.field`).
- **Handle**: A random string referring to an object in a process-local registry. Handles are temporary references, not serialized objects and not cross-process identities.
- **RSS**: A resolver's required selection set. The main engine resolves field resolver object and query RSSes before the proxy is called.
- **Re-entrant execution**: A remote resolver calling `ctx.query()` or `ctx.mutation()`, which must route back to the main engine.

                                                        | ctx.mutation()
                                                        v

                      v
              EngineExecutionContext.resolveSelectionSet()
```

The two processes do not share an engine, injector, schema object, executor instance, or registry. They must independently load compatible tenant code and schemas. Stable executor IDs connect the two bootstraps; request data crosses the boundary through protobuf messages and JSON payloads.

The implementation has four important ownership rules:

1. The main server owns the GraphQL request and `EngineExecutionContext`.
2. The main engine resolves field resolver RSSes before the remote call.
3. The remote server owns the executor instance that runs tenant code.
4. The main engine owns any re-entrant selection execution and final GraphQL completion.

## Main-Server Bootstrap

### Transport lifecycle

`RemoteResolverConfig.fromEnvironment()` accepts an explicit enablement value and reads the RRS
endpoint and callback port. The main server derives an exact `RemoteResolverSelection` from the
selected tenants' `ExecutionRegistryConfigFile` resources and passes it to `RemoteResolverInitializer`.
`RemoteResolverInitializer.initialize()` then:

1. Returns `ProxyResolverFactory.NO_OP` when remote execution is disabled.
2. Creates one shaded-Netty `ManagedChannel` to the configured RRS endpoint.
3. Starts a plaintext gRPC callback server containing `EngineCallbackServiceImpl`.
4. Advertises the callback endpoint as `<resolved-local-address>:<callback-port>`.
5. Builds a `RemoteProxyResolverFactory` that owns proxy-selection predicates but not the channel lifecycle.

Initialization is synchronized, idempotent, and safe for concurrent callers. `close()` is also idempotent, waits up to five seconds for each transport sequentially, forces shutdown when necessary, and makes the initializer terminal. Calling `initialize()` after `close()` fails.

The StarWars main server binds the initializer as a singleton with `preDestroy = "close"` and passes its factory to `ViaductBuilder.withProxyResolverFactory()`.

### Resolver replacement

During engine bootstrap, `DispatcherRegistryFactory` calls `ProxyResolverFactory.proxyNode()` and `proxyField()` for every tenant executor. A non-null result replaces the original executor in the engine's dispatcher registry. The proxy is also the executor that engine validation inspects, so it must preserve the original executor's runtime contract.

`RemoteProxyResolverFactory` does that by delegating:

- Node type, batching mode, selectivity, and metadata.
- Field object RSS, query RSS, batching mode, selectivity, resolver ID, and metadata.

Before returning a proxy, the factory derives the wire ID directly from the original executor (`typeName` for nodes and `resolverId` for fields). It does not register the original executor in the main process or mutate either executor registry. The remote process independently registers its compatible executor under the same stable ID.

### Proxy selection

The factory proxies exactly the node type names and field coordinates in
`RemoteResolverSelection`. Empty sets proxy nothing. Selective node and field resolvers are not
supported; registry-backed selection excludes them while retaining the tenant's other resolvers,
and the proxy factory skips them as a second line of defense.

Selective node resolvers cannot use the current response correlation by node ID when the same ID appears with different selections. Selective field resolver semantics likewise depend on the requested sub-selection. Both proxy constructors reject selective executors as a second line of defense.

## Remote-Server Bootstrap

The StarWars `TenantBootstrapper` demonstrates the remote process bootstrap:

1. `SchemaFactory.fromResources()` loads the schema from `.graphqls` resources.
2. `SchemaRegistry` publishes that schema for schema-only remote execution contexts.
3. `ExecutionRegistryConfigSourceCollector.fromResources()` finds tenant manifests under `META-INF/viaduct/modules/<package>.json`.
4. `BootstrapperFactory` and `SharedTenantModuleInjectorFactory` construct tenant module bootstrappers using the remote process's `CodeInjector`.
5. `builtinModuleConfigSources(...)` generates the built-in node and field resolver configs (`Query.node`/`Query.nodes` and `@namespaceType`) that are not present in tenant manifests, and they are bootstrapped through the same `BootstrapperFactory` path.
6. Node and field executors are registered by stable ID in `NodeExecutorRegistry` and `FieldExecutorRegistry`.

The schema filters which manifest entries are realized and supports field selection-set reconstruction. The remote process does not create a full `Viaduct` engine just to execute resolver executors.

Executor registration is later-wins. Re-registering the same instance is treated as idempotent; replacing a different instance under an existing ID logs a warning. The main and remote processes must agree on the logical resolver behind every proxied ID.

## Node Resolver Flow

`RemoteNodeProxyExecutor.resolve()` moves one engine-produced node batch across the network:

1. Register the main server's `EngineExecutionContext` in `ContextRegistry`.
2. Register each selector's `EngineSelectionSet` in `SelectionsRegistry`.
3. Build `BatchResolveNodeRequest` with the executor ID, node IDs, selection handles, context handle, and callback endpoint.
4. Call `RemoteResolverService.BatchResolveNode`.
5. Unregister the context and all selection handles in `finally`.
6. Correlate each `ResolvedNode` to the original selector by node ID.
7. Deserialize successful `EngineObjectData` and convert remote errors to `RemoteResolverException`.

On the remote server, `RemoteResolverServiceImpl.batchResolveNode()`:

1. Looks up the local node executor by stable type-name ID.
2. Builds a `UnaryRemoteEngineExecutionContext`.
3. Attempts to resolve each selection handle locally.
4. Uses `EmptyEngineSelectionSet(typeName)` on a registry miss.
5. Calls the remote process's node executor once with the reconstructed batch.
6. Serializes each successful node result independently.

Selection handles are process-local, and the node RPC does not carry a serialized selection set. Consequently, a separate RRS normally executes a non-selective node resolver with an empty selection set. The main engine still projects and completes the requested fields after the node returns. A future implementation that needs remote-side projection or selection-aware node execution must add a node selection-set wire representation.

The response uses node ID as its correlation key. This is why selective node resolvers, which may contain duplicate IDs with different selections, are unsupported.

## Field Resolver Flow

Field resolvers have a richer wire contract because their input and output types are open-ended.

### Main-side preparation

`RemoteFieldProxyExecutor` exposes the original executor's object and query RSSes. The main engine therefore resolves those RSSes before calling `batchResolve()`. For each field selector, the proxy serializes:

- The field arguments as JSON.
- The resolved object RSS value as `EngineObjectData` JSON.
- The resolved query RSS value as `EngineObjectData` JSON.
- The field's sub-selection set as both a process-local handle and a reconstructable wire form.

Field selectors have no natural unique ID and distinct selectors may compare equal. The proxy assigns the input index as `selector_key` and keeps the `(index, original selector)` pairing for response reconstruction.

Selection-set conversion is memoized by object identity within a batch. Viaduct commonly shares one `EngineSelectionSet` instance across all selectors for a field coordinate, so this avoids repeatedly registering and rendering the same fragment.

If argument, RSS value, or selection-set serialization fails, only that selector receives a failure. The remaining selectors are still sent. If every selector fails preparation, the proxy returns those failures without making an RPC.

### Remote-side reconstruction

`RemoteResolverServiceImpl.batchResolveField()`:

1. Looks up the local field executor by `Type.field`.
2. Builds a `UnaryRemoteEngineExecutionContext`.
3. Resolves the parent object type from the executor ID and the query type from the remote schema.
4. Deserializes object and query RSS values against those real schema types.
5. Deserializes arguments.
6. Uses a locally resolvable selection handle when available; otherwise reconstructs the serialized selection set against the remote schema.
7. Calls the remote field executor with all selectors that survived reconstruction.
8. Serializes each returned field value independently.

A serialized field selection set contains:

- The GraphQL type condition.
- A fragment document generated by `EngineSelectionSet.toFragment()`.
- Variables encoded as a JSON object.

A blank fragment document represents a non-null empty selection set, such as a composite field whose children were all skipped by directives. A missing `SerializedSelectionSet` represents a leaf field with no sub-selections.

Malformed arguments, RSS data, or selection documents fail only their selector. If no selector survives reconstruction, the service returns the accumulated errors without invoking the executor. This avoids calling an unbatched executor with an invalid empty batch.

### Result reconstruction

The proxy indexes the response by `selector_key`, requires one response for every sent selector, and deserializes each success against the main context's live schema. Pre-RPC failures and remote results are then combined into the map expected by `FieldResolverExecutor`.

The main engine performs normal field completion after the proxy returns. Remote execution does not move access checks, child query-plan execution, or GraphQL response completion into the RRS.

## Wire Formats

The protobuf schema defines two bidirectional services:

| Service | Direction | RPCs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RemoteResolverService` | Main to remote | `BatchResolveNode`, `BatchResolveField` |
| `EngineCallbackService` | Remote to main | `ExecuteQuery`, `ExecuteMutation` |

The protobuf messages use `bytes` fields for JSON payloads. Protobuf defines RPC structure and correlation; Jackson encodes resolver values.

### Engine values

`EngineObjectDataSerializer` is the single codec for every engine value this transport carries:
`EngineObjectData` payloads (node results, required-selection-set object and query values, callback
results) and field-resolver return values. `FieldValueSerializer` is the field path's facade over it,
and also owns the plain-JSON argument and variable maps.

Only JSON *objects* are enveloped, because only they are ambiguous — a bare JSON object could be an
`EngineObjectData` or a map-valued custom scalar. Primitives, nulls and lists stay bare, so scalars
pay no encoding overhead:

| Value | JSON |
| --- | --- |
| `EngineObjectData.Sync` | `{"o":{"t":"<Type>","f":{<selection>: <value>}}}` |
| `NodeReference` | `{"r":{"t":"<Type>","id":"<globalId>"}}` |
| Map-valued scalar | `{"s":{ …opaque JSON… }}` |
| List | `[<value>, …]` |
| String, number, boolean | Bare JSON scalar |
| Null | Bare JSON `null` |
| Unset selection | Key absent from `"f"` |

Because each object records its concrete type name, type identity survives at every depth: nested
objects are rebuilt against the receiver's real schema type, so consumers that read type identity
below the root (GRT reflection, interface and union membership, Classic interop) work. Only the
`"s"` payload is opaque — nothing inside it is encoded, so nothing inside it can be decoded, and an
`EngineObjectData` or `NodeReference` hidden in a map is rejected at serialize time.

`NodeReference` is checked before `EngineObjectData` because the engine's node reference
implementation satisfies both interfaces. A reference is only legal in a field-value payload; an
`EngineObjectData` payload must be fully resolved, so a nested reference is rejected instead of
recursively awaiting a node that never resolves. Callers convert that to a selector-level failure.

Deserialization takes the type the receiver *independently* knows the payload must have — a node's
type, a field's parent type, a selection set's type — and asserts the wire agrees, rather than
trusting the wire. A mislabelled payload is therefore rejected instead of being accepted as a
different-but-known type. Field values are the one exception: a field's declared type may be
abstract, so the concrete type comes from the wire and is resolved against the live full schema.

Supported scalar leaves are strings, booleans, and numbers. Arbitrary objects, sets, sequences, and
custom scalar values requiring bespoke coercion are rejected.

The payload root is `[<version>, <value>]`. A JSON array root is structurally impossible in the
pre-versioned format, which always wrote an object, so a build mismatch between the two processes
fails loudly in both directions rather than decoding into a wrong-but-plausible value. There is no
dual-read path: main and remote servers must still be built from compatible commits and deployed
together, and the version exists so that violating it is diagnosable rather than silent. Note the
version covers the engine values above; `arguments_json` and `variables_json` are plain JSON maps with
no envelope of their own, and proto-level skew is not covered either.

Self-describing objects cost roughly `19 + len(typeName)` bytes per object that the previous format
did not, at every depth, against gRPC's unchanged 4 MiB default inbound limit. (Field-*value* payloads
got smaller, since per-scalar tagging went away, so this applies to node, required-selection-set and
callback payloads.) A batch already within a couple of MB of that ceiling should be measured before
being proxied. If the limit ever does need raising, note two things: decoding materializes a generic
object tree several times the size of the wire bytes, so headroom costs far more heap than wire; and
`maxInboundMessageSize` on the abstract `io.grpc.ServerBuilder`/`ManagedChannelBuilder` is documented
as advisory and does nothing, so every receiver must be built from the concrete Netty builder for a
limit to apply at all.

## Re-entrant Query and Mutation Flow

`UnaryRemoteEngineExecutionContext` implements `resolveSelectionSet()` by calling back to the main process:

1. Convert the requested `EngineSelectionSet` to a fragment and serialize its type, document, and variables into `QueryRequest.selections`.
2. Send the serialized selection set and the main server's context handle to `ExecuteMutation` or `ExecuteQuery`, chosen from the operation type.
3. Resolve the `ContextRegistry.Registration` on the main server and reconstruct the selection set with the registered engine context. A process-local selection handle remains as a fallback for callers that do not send serialized selections.
4. Restore the request-scoped coroutine elements captured when the context was registered while retaining the callback RPC's `Job` and dispatcher.
5. Call the original main `EngineExecutionContext.resolveSelectionSet()`.
6. Serialize the resulting `EngineObjectData`.
7. Deserialize it in the remote process against the remote schema and the selection set's original type.

The context handle works across the callback because it was created and remains registered in the main process; the callback request returns that string to its owner. The registration also holds the coroutine context captured by the outbound proxy so request-scoped context is available during re-entrant execution.

Unary `ctx.query()` and `ctx.mutation()` callbacks do not depend on a shared `SelectionsRegistry`. The serialized selection set crosses the process boundary and the main server reconstructs it before execution.

Other context behavior in a separate process is intentionally partial:

- `fullSchema`, `scopedSchema`, and `activeSchema` use `SchemaRegistry`.
- `engineSelectionSetFactory` is built from the local schema.
- `globalIDCodec` falls back to `GlobalIDCodecDefault`.
- `createNodeReference()` creates a lightweight remote reference for result serialization.
- `requestContext` and `executionHandle` are `null` without a delegate.
- `engine`, `fieldScope`, `createRootFieldReference()`, and `completeSelectionSet()` require an in-process delegate and otherwise throw.
- `hasModernNodeResolver()` returns `false` without a delegate.

Resolvers that depend on those unsupported context members are not network-compatible today.

## Registries and State Lifetime

All registries are in-memory JVM singletons:

| Registry | Key | Value | Typical owner and lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ContextRegistry` | Random UUID | `ContextRegistry.Registration` (`EngineExecutionContext` and captured coroutine context) | Main server, one outbound RPC; removed in proxy `finally` |
| `SelectionsRegistry` | Random UUID | `EngineSelectionSet` | Main server node or field proxy call; removed in proxy `finally`; same-JVM callback fallback |
| `NodeExecutorRegistry` | GraphQL type name | `NodeResolverExecutor` | RRS process, bootstrap to shutdown |
| `FieldExecutorRegistry` | `Type.field` | `FieldResolverExecutor` | RRS process, bootstrap to shutdown |
| `SchemaRegistry` | Singleton slot | `ViaductSchema` | Remote process, bootstrap to shutdown |

`ContextRegistry`, `SelectionsRegistry`, and executor registries use `ConcurrentHashMap`. Every context registration returns a fresh UUID, even when concurrent RPCs use the same context, so one request's cleanup cannot remove another's entry.

Do not treat registry handles as globally resolvable. A handle lookup succeeds in integration tests because both gRPC services run in one JVM; that is not evidence that the same lookup works between deployed processes.

## Errors and Batch Isolation

The transport preserves success versus failure per selector but does not preserve the original exception object:

- `ErrorInfo` carries only the exception message and fully qualified class name.
- The main proxy reconstructs it as `RemoteResolverException`.
- Causes, stack traces, structured GraphQL errors, and framework-versus-tenant exception markers do not cross the wire.

Failure boundaries are:

- Unknown executor IDs are gRPC `NOT_FOUND` errors for the whole RPC.
- Main-side field selector serialization failures affect only that selector.
- Remote-side field selector reconstruction failures affect only that selector.
- A resolver method throwing outside its returned `Result` fails every surviving selector in that invocation.
- A failure returned for one selector affects only that selector.
- Node and field result serialization failures affect only the corresponding selector.
- Field result deserialization failures on the main side affect only that selector.
- Missing or unknown response correlation keys are treated as transport invariant violations.
- `CancellationException` is always rethrown rather than converted into a resolver result.
- gRPC transport failures and deadlines propagate through the coroutine stub.

`RemoteProxyResolverFactory` supports an optional per-request deadline. `RemoteResolverInitializer` currently does not configure one, so its default network calls rely on gRPC's unbounded default.

## Channels, Security, and Shutdown

The main initializer owns one RRS channel and one callback server. Each `RemoteResolverServiceImpl` caches one callback channel per advertised endpoint in a `ConcurrentHashMap`; creating a channel per request would create a Netty thread pool per request. The RRS host must call `shutdownChannels()` during shutdown.

Both directions currently use plaintext gRPC. There is no TLS, authentication, authorization, or request metadata propagation in this experimental transport. The callback endpoint advertised by the main process must be routable from the remote process.

The StarWars `RemoteServer` demonstrates one-shot lifecycle management:

- It starts `RemoteResolverServiceImpl` and gRPC reflection on the configured port.
- It drains callback channels before shutting down the server.
- It waits 30 seconds for graceful shutdown and then five seconds after forced shutdown.
- A JVM shutdown hook calls `stop()`.

## Build and Packaging

The remote resolver library is a separate included Gradle build under `core/x/remoteresolvers/lib`. It is source-substituted into the OSS and core composites but is not a participating publication and is not published to Maven Central.

`core/x/remoteresolvers` is a second, self-contained composite for the StarWars main and remote demo servers. It includes Viaduct core, publications, Gradle plugins, the remote resolver library, and the StarWars tenant modules from source.

The demo illustrates both sides of the integration:

- `starwars/main-server` embeds Viaduct, installs the proxy factory, and owns the callback server.
- `starwars/remote-server` loads schema and tenant manifests, supplies a Guice-backed `CodeInjector`, registers executors, and owns the RRS server.

## Testing

The test suite covers several different layers:

- `RemoteProxyIntegrationTest`: Node proxying, batching, error propagation, node serialization isolation, and callback initiation.
- `RemoteFieldProxyIntegrationTest`: Field inputs and results, RSS data, selection reconstruction, batching, per-selector isolation, and callback initiation.
- `RemoteSelectionSetWireTest`: Fragment and variable round-tripping for field sub-selections.
- `UnaryCallbackSelectionWireTest`: Unary query and mutation callback reconstruction without selection handles, including variables and callback thread-local context setup.
- `EngineObjectDataSerializerTest`, `FieldValueSerializerTest` and `EmptyEngineSelectionSetTest`: Wire codec and empty-selection behavior.
- Registry tests: Stable executor registration and schema publication.
- Configuration and initializer tests: Parsing, selection policy, lifecycle, and built-in exclusions.
- StarWars remote-server tests: Tenant bootstrap and server lifecycle.

Most end-to-end library tests use gRPC's in-process transport and run both services in one JVM. They validate RPC wiring and serialization but can accidentally resolve process-local handles. `UnaryCallbackSelectionWireTest` avoids that false positive by executing query and mutation callbacks without a registered selection handle. It still does not launch separate JVMs.

For a behavior that depends on process separation, add a test that prevents shared registry access or launches separate JVMs. In particular, a successful in-process callback test does not establish that re-entrant execution works over the deployed network topology.
