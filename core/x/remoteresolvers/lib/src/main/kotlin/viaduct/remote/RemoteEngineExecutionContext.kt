/**
 * [EngineExecutionContext] shared by both remote-resolver transports: unary gRPC
 * ([UnaryRemoteEngineExecutionContext]) and bidirectional streaming
 * ([RemoteResolverStreamExecutionContext]). Neither transport carries a live engine to resolve
 * against off this JVM, so every member but [resolveSelectionSet] is schema-only when [delegate]
 * is `null`: members that need local engine state throw; [localSchema] and [GlobalIDCodecDefault]
 * cover the common cases. Only how a re-entrant ctx.query()/ctx.mutation() call
 * ([resolveSelectionSet]) reaches back to the engine differs by transport -- unary calls back over
 * a persistent gRPC channel keyed by a context handle, streaming dispatches over the request's
 * own stream -- so it's the one abstract member.
