/**
 * The streaming-transport [RemoteEngineExecutionContext]: always schema-only (`delegate = null`
 * on the base) -- the streaming design has no context_handle to resolve against a process-local
 * registry, so a remotely-run resolver's re-entrant calls always cross the wire via [dispatcher],
 * never a local shortcut. [resolveSelectionSet] is the only member that needs an override here;
 * every other member (schema access, node references, global ID codec, etc.) is inherited as-is
 * from the base's no-delegate fallback path. (Contrast with [UnaryRemoteEngineExecutionContext],
 * the unary transport's context, which does support a delegate for same-JVM testing.)
