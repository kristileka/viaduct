# spring-starter (placeholder)

This is a **placeholder** end-to-end demo application for the Viaduct Java API.

Despite the directory name, it does **not** yet use the Spring Framework. The current entry point (`com.example.viadapp.ViaductApplication`) is a plain Java `main()` that builds a `Viaduct` instance directly via `ViaductBuilder` and executes a single GraphQL operation from the command line.

The intent is to evolve this demo into a proper Spring Boot application that shows how to embed Viaduct's Java API inside a Spring-managed web service. Until then, treat this app as scaffolding — the package layout, resolver wiring, and Gradle plugin configuration are in place, but the Spring integration is intentionally deferred.

For a fully-fledged (non-Spring) Viaduct demo, see [`demoapps/starwars`](../starwars).
