description: API Stability Annotations in Viaduct

## Canonical stability annotations

The api stability rules are defined in tenant/api (including generated code), service/api and service/wiring.

A declaration may be annotated with **exactly one** of the following stability annotations:

- `@StableApi`
- `@ExperimentalApi`
- `@InternalApi`
- `@VisibleForTest`

Having more than one stability annotation on the same declaration is invalid and enforced by a Detekt rule.

> Terminology: in this document, “declaration” includes classes, functions, properties, constructors, nested types, and type aliases.

## One stability annotation per declaration

To keep semantics unambiguous, Viaduct enforces:

- Each declaration may have **at most one** of `@StableApi`, `@ExperimentalApi`, `@InternalApi`, or `@VisibleForTest`.
- Multiple stability annotations on the same declaration are invalid and are enforced by tooling.

## `@Deprecated` and lifecycle transitions

`@Deprecated` is treated as a lifecycle state; when an API becomes deprecated, the previous stability annotation is removed (not combined).  Represents a lifecycle state (migration signal) for an API that was previously stable and is being retired.

Project policy for public-facing APIs:

- Deprecated APIs **do not** carry another stability annotation in combination.
- When an API becomes deprecated, the previous stability annotation is removed.

### Practical rule of thumb

- If it is deprecated, annotate it with `@Deprecated(...)` and **do not** keep `@StableApi` / `@ExperimentalApi` on the same declaration.
- If you still want to communicate “this was stable”, do that in the deprecation `message` and/or KDoc.

## Quick decision tree

1. **Is this intended to be used by consumers (tenant services / external adopters)?**
   - Yes → `@StableApi` or `@ExperimentalApi`.
   - No → go to #2.

2. **Is this only present to support Viaduct’s own tests/fixtures/diagnostics, but must ship in a production artifact?**
   - Yes → `@VisibleForTest`.
   - No → `@InternalApi`.

3. **Is the API being retired?**
   - Yes → `@Deprecated(...)` (and remove the stability annotation).

## Valid combinations (and where they apply)

### Per-declaration rules

| What you want | Valid? | How |
|---|---:|---|
| Mark something stable | ✅ | Apply `@StableApi` on the declaration |
| Mark something experimental | ✅ | Apply `@ExperimentalApi` on the declaration |
| Mark something internal-only | ✅ | Apply `@InternalApi` on the declaration |
| Mark something test-only | ✅ | Apply `@VisibleForTest` on the declaration |
| Multiple stability annotations on one declaration | ❌ | Detekt failure |
| Deprecate a previously stable API and keep `@StableApi` | ❌ | Use only `@Deprecated(...)` |

### Enclosing scope behavior (coverage + BCV)

**Enclosing stability counts as coverage for Detekt**:

- A member is considered “covered” if it has a stability annotation itself **or** any enclosing declaration has one.

**Enclosing non-public markers affect BCV `.api` output**:

- A declaration appears in `.api` dumps only if it is public/protected **and** neither it nor any enclosing declaration has a `nonPublicMarker` (such as `@InternalApi` or `@VisibleForTest`).

### Overrides and private declarations

The Detekt rule ignores:

- private declarations,
- overrides (stability is defined by the base declaration),
- local declarations inside functions.

## Practical examples

### Example A: Stable public class with an internal helper

```kotlin
@StableApi
class PublicController {

    fun publicEndpoint() {} // OK: covered by @StableApi on the class

    @InternalApi
    fun internalHelper() {}  // OK: member has its own stability
}
```

The Detekt rule will not complain about the stable member coverage pattern shown above.

**What happens:**

- `PublicController` and `publicEndpoint()` are part of the tracked public surface (BCV will dump them).
- `internalHelper()` is treated as non-public for BCV (because `@InternalApi` is a non-public marker).

### Example B: Internal class filters out all its members from `.api`

```kotlin
@InternalApi
class InternalOnlyService {
    fun methodA() {}
    fun methodB() {}
}
```

BCV behavior:

- the class and its members do not appear in `.api` dumps because the enclosing class is a `nonPublicMarker`.

### Example C: Experimental API (opt-in warning for consumers)

```kotlin
@ExperimentalApi
fun newCapability(): String = "v2"
```

Call-site behavior without opt-in:

- `@ExperimentalApi` uses `@RequiresOptIn(level = WARNING)`, so consumers see a compiler warning unless they opt in.

Consumer-like usage:

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalApi::class)
fun useIt() {
    newCapability()
}
```

### Example D: `@VisibleForTest` is test-only

`@VisibleForTest` uses `@RequiresOptIn(level = WARNING)` to express “tests only”.

```kotlin
@VisibleForTest
fun internalTestHook() { /* ... */ }
```

A consumer-like module calling it without opt-in gets a compiler warning.

### Example E: Deprecating a stable API

When retiring a stable API, replace its stability annotation with `@Deprecated(...)`.

```kotlin
@Deprecated(
    message = "Use newFoo() instead.",
    replaceWith = ReplaceWith("newFoo()")
)
fun oldFoo() { /* ... */ }

@StableApi
fun newFoo() { /* ... */ }
```

## Invalid examples (and why)

### Invalid: Two stability annotations on one declaration

```kotlin
@InternalApi
@ExperimentalApi
fun dangerousExperimentalHelper() = Unit
```

This is disallowed. Even though Kotlin could combine the opt-ins, Viaduct enforces “pick one stability annotation per declaration.”

## How opt-in is configured across Viaduct modules

Kotlin compiler `-opt-in=...` flags act like module-wide `@OptIn`.

Typical configuration:

- **Internal Viaduct modules** opt in to `InternalApi`, `ExperimentalApi`, and `VisibleForTest` to avoid scattering `@OptIn` in the implementation.
- **Consumer-like code** (including demo apps and `testFixtures`) must use `@OptIn` explicitly for internal/experimental usage.

## What counts as the public API surface for semver?

The short answer: **if the binary compatibility validation (BCV) passes, the public API surface has not changed.**

BCV tracks every declaration that appears in a module's `.api` dump. A declaration only appears there if it is public/protected **and** neither it nor any enclosing declaration carries a non-public marker (`@InternalApi`, `@VisibleForTest`). That means:

- **`@StableApi` code** — fully tracked by BCV. Renames, removals, or signature changes here are breaking and will fail BCV.
- **`@ExperimentalApi` code** — also tracked by BCV, but consumers have opted in to potential churn. Prefer to use deprecation cycles where practical, but a change is not a semver violation in the strong sense.
- **`@InternalApi` code** — excluded from BCV dumps. Changes are never considered breaking, regardless of package name.
- **`.internal` packages (e.g. `runtime.internal`)** — package placement alone does not grant "internal" status for BCV purposes. Only the `@InternalApi` annotation (or an enclosing declaration that carries it) removes a declaration from the tracked surface. A rename inside a package named `.internal` is still safe if the class is annotated `@InternalApi`; without the annotation, it would still appear in the dump.
- **`@VisibleForTest`** — should never be used in the public API surface. Intended only for internal code, e.g., code in `runtime` packages.

### Practical guidance for new APIs

If you are introducing an API whose final shape is not yet clear, prefer `@ExperimentalApi` over `@StableApi`. This signals to consumers that breakage is possible, keeps the design flexible, and still gives the API real-world exposure. Avoid the temptation to use `@InternalApi` as a holding area for APIs you intend to eventually make public — only use it for code that is genuinely not intended for external consumption.

### The litmus test

> **Is BCV green?** → the public API surface is unchanged and the change is safe from a semver perspective.

If BCV fails, you have two options: revert the incompatible change, or follow the deprecation cycle (mark old API `@Deprecated`, introduce the replacement, and remove the old form in a future major/minor release per the project's deprecation policy).

## Adding BCV to a new module

When applying `id("conventions.bcv-api")` to a new module, three steps are required:

1. Add `id("conventions.bcv-api")` to the module's `build.gradle.kts`.
2. Run `./gradlew runApiDump` to generate the initial `.api` dump file and commit it.
3. Create a `MANDATORY_REVIEWERS` file in the same directory as the `.api` file, listing the API owners. This file gates PR approval on those owners whenever the `.api` dump changes — without it, breaking API changes can be merged without review from the people responsible for the public surface.

Example `MANDATORY_REVIEWERS` (placed next to the `.api` file):

```
@raymie-stata @aileen-chen @airbnb/viaduct
```

> **Note:** `MANDATORY_REVIEWERS` files are Treehouse-internal and are excluded from OSS sync via `.copybara/copy.bara.sky`. They do not need to be ported to the public repository.
