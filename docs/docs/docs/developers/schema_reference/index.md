description: Viaduct's built-in directives, types, scalars, and schema components
---


Viaduct automatically provides a rich set of built-in schema components that are available in every application. This reference documents the directives, types, scalars, and other schema elements provided by the framework.

## Built-in Directives

Viaduct includes core directives that are fundamental to the framework's functionality. These directives are automatically available and cannot be overridden.

### @resolver

Marks fields or types that require custom resolution logic. This is the primary mechanism for implementing data fetching in Viaduct.

**Locations:** `FIELD_DEFINITION`, `OBJECT`

**Arguments:**

- `isSelective: Boolean! = false` — enables selective resolution
- `isBatching: Boolean! = false` — when `true`, codegen generates a `batchResolve` method instead of `resolve`, enabling batch resolution for the field or type

**Example:**

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @resolver
}

type User @resolver {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String
  friends: [User] @resolver(isBatching: true)
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Fields that fetch data from external services or databases
- Fields that require custom business logic beyond simple property access
- Object types that need node resolution for Global ID support
- Fields or types that benefit from batch loading (`isBatching: true`)

When you apply `@resolver` to a field, Viaduct generates an abstract resolver class that you must implement. The generated class contains either a `resolve` method (default) or a `batchResolve` method (when `isBatching: true`) — never both. At startup, Viaduct validates that the `isBatching` flag in the schema matches the method your resolver implements. See [Resolvers](../resolvers/index.md) and [Batch Resolution](../resolvers/batch_resolution.md) for details.

### @backingData

Specifies the backing data class for a field, enabling type-safe data access in resolvers. A backing-data field is an implementation detail: Viaduct keeps it available for use in required selection sets only in the module that defines the field. The field is not available in other modules or in any externally published schemas.

**Locations:** `FIELD_DEFINITION`

**Arguments:**

- `class: String!` — fully qualified name of the backing data class

**Example:**

```graphql
type User {
  profileData: BackingData
    @backingData(class: "com.example.data.UserProfileData")
    @resolver
}
```

The field's base type must be `BackingData`, and a field whose base type is `BackingData` must carry `@backingData`. Backing-data fields can only be declared directly on object types; they cannot be declared on interfaces, inherited from interfaces, or used as input fields.

See the [`@backingData` guide](../../../getting_started/starwars/directives/backing_data.md) for a complete resolver example.

### @tenantLocal

Marks an internal field that is available to code in the field's owning tenant but is not part of a client-executable schema. This directive is only applicable to fields whose base type is a scalar (for example, `Int`) or `BackingData`. `BackingData` fields and `@parent` fields are also tenant-local automatically; they do not need this directive.

**Locations:** `FIELD_DEFINITION`

**Example:**

```graphql
type User {
  profileCacheKey: String! @tenantLocal
}
```

Viaduct keeps tenant-local fields in the internal full schema so generated code, resolver required selection sets, and execution internals can use them. It removes them from Base and Scoped executable schemas, so clients cannot query them.

An explicit `@tenantLocal` field:

- Must return a scalar or `BackingData` type. Lists and non-null wrappers are allowed.
- Must be declared directly on an object type.
- Cannot be declared on an interface or implement a field inherited from an interface.

Fields with the `@parent` directive and fields whose base type is `BackingData` have the same schema-visibility behavior automatically. Do not add `@tenantLocal` merely to make those fields private.

### @parent

Marks a field that resolves to the object from which the current object was reached during execution. The engine resolves the field from execution ancestry; it does not invoke a field resolver for it.

**Locations:** `FIELD_DEFINITION`

**Example:**

```graphql
type Company {
  name: String!
  user: User @resolver
}

type User {
  parent: Company @parent
  companyDisplayName: String @resolver
}
```

A resolver or checker for a field on `User` can include `parent { name }` in its required selection set. See [Parent fields in required selection sets](../resolvers/field_resolvers.md#parent-fields-in-required-selection-sets).

Parent fields:

- Are tenant-local automatically and are removed from Base and Scoped executable schemas.
- Must be declared directly on an object type, not on an interface or an inherited interface field.
- May be nullable or non-null and return an object, interface, or union type, but cannot return a list.
- Cannot take arguments or carry `@resolver`; the engine resolves the field from execution ancestry.
- Require exactly one non-`@parent` field in the schema whose unwrapped return type is the child type. That producer field's containing type must be compatible with the declared parent return type.
- Cannot target a type with a selective type resolver or a parent value whose nearest upstream field resolver is selective.

The `@resolver` restriction applies to the `@parent` field, not to the field that produces the child. A producer field may carry `@resolver` and may return the child directly, in a list, or in a nested list. A non-selective resolver that produces the parent value is also allowed; it prevents a selective resolver farther upstream from affecting this validation.

### @namespaceType

Groups related fields under a dedicated type that acts as an organizational namespace on the root query type. The engine auto-resolves fields that return a namespace type — no resolver is needed for the namespace field itself.

**Locations:** `OBJECT`

**Example:**

```graphql
type Query {
  listings: Listings
}

type Listings @namespaceType {
  availableRoomTypes: [RoomType] @resolver
  pricing: ListingsPricing
}

type ListingsPricing @namespaceType {
  currencyOptions: [Currency] @resolver
}
```

See [Namespace Types](../namespace_types/index.md) for detailed documentation.

### @scope

Controls field and type visibility across different schema scopes. This is a repeatable directive that enables multi-tenant or multi-variant schemas.

**Locations:** `OBJECT`, `INTERFACE`, `UNION`, `ENUM`, `INPUT_OBJECT`, `FIELD_DEFINITION`, `ENUM_VALUE`

**Arguments:**

- `to: [String!]!` — list of scope names where this element is visible

**Example:**

```graphql
type User @scope(to: ["public"]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String @scope(to: ["internal"])
  adminNotes: String @scope(to: ["admin"])
}

type InternalMetrics @scope(to: ["internal"]) {
  requestCount: Long!
  errorRate: Float!
}
```

See [Scopes](../scopes/index.md) for detailed documentation on using scopes.

### @idOf

Declares that an `ID` field or argument represents a Global ID for a specific GraphQL type. When a field or argument has `@idOf`, Viaduct generates code using `GlobalID<T>` instead of `String` in the resolver signature. This enables type-safe ID handling.

**Locations:** `FIELD_DEFINITION`, `INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION`, `ARGUMENT_DEFINITION`

**Arguments:**

- `type: String!` — name of the GraphQL type this ID references (must implement `Node`)

**Example:**

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID! @idOf(type: "User")): User @resolver
  users(ids: [ID!]! @idOf(type: "User")): [User!]! @resolver
}

input UpdateUserInput {
  userId: ID! @idOf(type: "User")
  name: String
}
```

See [Global IDs](../globalids/index.md) for more information.

## Built-in Types

### Node Interface

The standard GraphQL Relay Node interface for entity identification. Viaduct automatically includes this interface when it's used in your schema.

**Definition:**

```graphql
interface Node @scope(to: ["*"]) {
  id: ID!
}
```

**When it's included:**

- Your schema implements types that extend `Node`
- You use the `@idOf` directive anywhere in your schema

**Example usage:**

```graphql
type User implements Node {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Post implements Node {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: User @resolver
}
```

### Node Query Fields

Viaduct automatically provides these root query fields when your schema uses the `Node` interface:

```graphql
extend type Query @scope(to: ["*"]) {
  node(id: ID!): Node
  nodes(ids: [ID!]!): [Node]!
}
```

`Query.node` and `Query.nodes` come with built-in resolvers that work with Viaduct's Global ID system: based on the type embedded in a GlobalID, they will automatically call that type's node-resolver to obtain their results.

## Built-in Scalars

Viaduct provides extended scalar types beyond GraphQL's standard scalars (`Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`, `ID`). These are automatically available without explicit declaration.

### Date

ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

**Example value:** `"2024-10-29"`

**Kotlin type mapping:** `java.time.LocalDate`

### DateTime

ISO 8601 date-time format with timezone.

**Example value:** `"2024-10-29T14:30:00Z"`

**Kotlin type mapping:** `java.time.Instant`

### Long

64-bit signed integer, beyond GraphQL's standard `Int` (32-bit).

**Example value:** `9223372036854775807`

**Kotlin type mapping:** `Long`

### BigDecimal

Arbitrary precision decimal number.

**Example value:** `"123.456789012345"`

**Kotlin type mapping:** `java.math.BigDecimal`

### BigInteger

Arbitrary precision integer.

**Example value:** `"12345678901234567890"`

**Kotlin type mapping:** `java.math.BigInteger`

### JSON

Represents any JSON value, including objects, arrays, and scalar values.

**Example value:** `{"key": "value", "nested": {"count": 42}}`

**Generated type mappings:**

- Kotlin: `Any?` for `JSON`, or `Any` for `JSON!`
- Java: `Object`; nullability follows the GraphQL field or argument declaration

These language-specific types expose the same recursive runtime JSON value model.

#### Resolver inputs

For a `JSON` argument or input field, resolvers receive a recursively decoded JSON value:

- JSON objects become `Map<String, Any?>` in Kotlin or `Map<String, Object>` in Java.
- JSON arrays become `List<Any?>` in Kotlin or `List<Object>` in Java.
- JSON strings, booleans, and null become `String`, `Boolean`, and `null`.
- JSON numbers become a subtype of `java.lang.Number`.

Do not depend on a particular numeric subtype. The concrete type can differ based on whether
the value came from a literal or variable and on conversions performed while passing the value
to the resolver.

Values nested inside `JSON` do not use Viaduct's other scalar coercions. For example, dates and
timestamps are strings, not `LocalDate` or `Instant`.

#### Resolver outputs

Resolvers should produce a recursively JSON-compatible value:

- `Map<String, Any?>` in Kotlin or `Map<String, Object>` in Java for objects, with string keys
- `List<Any?>` in Kotlin or `List<Object>` in Java for arrays
- `String`, `Boolean`, `Number`, or `null` for scalar values

Standard JVM numeric types, including `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `BigInteger`, and
`BigDecimal`, represent JSON numbers; `BigDecimal` is not required. This includes Kotlin `Int`
and Java `int`, which are boxed as `java.lang.Integer` when used as an `Any` or `Object` value.

Viaduct does not call `toString()` on other object types to turn them into JSON strings. The
embedding application's JSON serializer may serialize such values as objects or reject them, so
resolvers should explicitly convert arbitrary objects, dates, and timestamps to the
JSON-compatible representation they intend to expose.

### BackingData

Internal marker type used by fields carrying the `@backingData` directive. A backing-data field's base type must be `BackingData`; Viaduct maps its value to the class named by the directive.

## Root Types

Viaduct intelligently manages root types based on your schema definitions:

### Query

**Always created.** Required by the GraphQL specification.

You must use `extend type Query` in your schema files:

```graphql
extend type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @resolver
  users(limit: Int = 10): [User!]! @resolver
}
```

### Mutation

**Created only when mutation extensions exist.** Viaduct automatically creates the `Mutation` root type when it detects `extend type Mutation` in your schema.

```graphql
extend type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): CreateUserPayload @resolver
  updateUser(id: ID!, input: UpdateUserInput!): UpdateUserPayload @resolver
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do

- **Use `extend type` for all root types** — Never define `Query` or `Mutation` directly
- **Apply `@resolver` to fields fetching external data** — This is how Viaduct knows which fields need custom logic
- **Use `@idOf` for type-safe IDs** — Leverage compile-time validation for ID references
- **Apply `@scope` explicitly to sensitive fields** — Don't rely on implicit visibility
- **Leverage built-in scalars** — Use `DateTime`, `Long`, `BigDecimal` instead of strings or custom scalars
- **Implement Node interface for entities** — Use for globally identifiable objects

### Don't

- **Don't override core directives** — Framework directives such as `@resolver`, `@backingData`, `@tenantLocal`, `@parent`, `@scope`, and `@idOf` are provided automatically
- **Don't redefine standard scalars** — They're automatically available
- **Don't manually add the Node interface** — It's added automatically when used
- **Don't forget to extend root types** — Always use `extend type Query`, not `type Query`
