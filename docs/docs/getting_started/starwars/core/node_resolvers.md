title: Node Resolvers
description: Implementing node resolvers in Viaduct for type-safe, opaque Global ID lookups.
---


Node resolvers provide **typed lookups by Global ID**. Any entity that must be fetched individually through the GraphQL `node(id:)` entry point should have a corresponding node resolver. Viaduct decodes the incoming Global ID, hands your resolver the **internal ID** via `ctx.id.internalID`, and expects you to return the typed GraphQL object. Keep node resolvers tiny: _lookup → build → return_.

## Request lifecycle (node)

1. Client calls `node(id: ID!)`.
2. Viaduct decodes the Global ID into its type and internal ID components.
3. Viaduct uses the type component to find the corresponding node resolver and call it passing the decoded Global ID as `Context.id`.
4. Your resolver loads the record and builds the response using `Character.of(ctx) { ... }` or a dedicated builder class (for example, `CharacterBuilder(ctx).build(entity)`).

### Handling "not found"

GraphQL's [error specification](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) gives you two reasonable choices when an entity isn't found: return `null` (and let `node` show the absence to the client) or surface a typed error. The Star Wars demo throws an `IllegalArgumentException` because, in this demo, an unknown ID is treated as a programming error. Most production node resolvers prefer `null` so that callers can branch on presence without a query failure. Whichever you pick, reserve exceptions for **unexpected** conditions (I/O errors, decoding failures, programming bugs).

## Common patterns that pair with node resolvers

### Lightweight builders
Populate only intrinsic, low-cost fields in the node resolver. Related entities (homeworld, species, films) should be resolved via **field resolvers** — which Viaduct can batch efficiently per request.

### Stable IDs
Always generate IDs with `ctx.globalIDFor(<Type>.Reflection, internalId)` to keep them **opaque and stable** across module or storage backends.

### Query example (client)

```graphql
query GetNode($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on Character {
      id
      name
      homeworld { name }   # resolved later via a field resolver (can batch)
      species { name }     # resolved later via a field resolver (can batch)
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration testing

Node resolvers are most usefully exercised by integration tests that issue real `node(id:)` queries against a configured Viaduct instance. Verify:

- **ID shape:** the `id` returned in the response is the typed Global ID you emitted from `ctx.globalIDFor(...)`.
- **Composability:** related fields (homeworld, species, film counts) resolve via field resolvers, not by extra work inside the node resolver.
- **Not-found behavior:** the resolver behaves consistently with whatever convention you chose (`null` or a typed error).

> See `ResolverIntegrationTest.kt` and `StarWarsNodeResolversTest.kt` in the demo for examples of end-to-end node behavior.

## Do and don’t

- **Do** keep node resolvers tiny: _lookup → build → return_.
- **Do** load a single entity by its internal ID and attach a Global ID with `ctx.globalIDFor(<Type>.Reflection, internalId)`.
- **Do** lean on field resolvers for relationships and heavy logic.
- **Don’t** perform per-request joins here; you'll lose batching opportunities.
- **Don’t** leak internal IDs — always emit typed Global IDs in the `id` field.
