## Worked Examples

These step-by-step examples will teach you how to build powerful GraphQL APIs with minimal code.

### How It Works:

1. **Write GraphQL schema** with `@resolver` directives

2. **Build your project** - Viaduct generates resolver base classes

3. **Implement resolvers** - Extend generated classes with your logic

4. **Get a working API** - Type-safe, performant GraphQL server

### Example Path

Follow these examples in order to master Viaduct's resolver patterns. The complete set of feature-app tutorials lives in [`core/tenant/tutorials/src/test/kotlin/viaduct/tenant`](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/tree/main/core/tenant/tutorials/src/test/kotlin/viaduct/tenant); the entries below are the curated path we recommend working through first.

#### [Field Resolver Tutorial](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/blob/main/core/tenant/tutorials/src/test/kotlin/viaduct/tenant/tutorial01/SimpleFieldResolverFeatureAppTest.kt)

**Start here!** Learn the most basic resolver type.

- **What you'll learn**: How to create computed fields with custom logic

- **Key concepts**: Field resolvers, Query type resolvers, `@Resolver` annotation

- **Example**: A simple `foo: String!` field that returns computed values

- **Generated classes**: `QueryResolvers.*`

#### [Node Resolver Tutorial](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/blob/main/core/tenant/tutorials/src/test/kotlin/viaduct/tenant/tutorial02/SimpleNodeResolverFeatureAppTest.kt)

Learn the foundation of Viaduct's object system.

- **What you'll learn**: How to create objects that can be refetched by ID

- **Key concepts**: Node interface, GlobalID system, Node resolvers

- **Example**: A `Foo` type that implements `Node` and can be resolved by ID

- **Generated classes**: `NodeResolvers.*`, Global ID encoding/decoding

- **Why it matters**: Foundation for all object resolution in Viaduct

#### [Simple Resolvers Tutorial](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/blob/main/core/tenant/tutorials/src/test/kotlin/viaduct/tenant/tutorial03/SimpleResolversFeatureAppTest.kt)

See how Field and Node resolvers work together.

- **What you'll learn**: How different resolver types interact

- **Key concepts**: `objectValueFragment`, accessing parent data, resolver composition

- **Example**: A `User` with computed `fullName` field using `firstname` + `lastname`

- **Generated classes**: `QueryResolvers.*`, `UserResolvers.*`, `NodeResolvers.*`

- **Advanced feature**: Field resolvers accessing parent object data

#### [Subqueries Tutorial](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct/blob/main/core/tenant/tutorials/src/test/kotlin/viaduct/tenant/tutorial11/SimpleSubqueriesFeatureAppTest.kt)

Execute subqueries against the Query and Mutation roots from inside a resolver.

- **What you'll learn**: How to use `ctx.query()` and `ctx.mutation()` to issue imperative subqueries

- **Key concepts**: `ctx.query()`, `ctx.mutation()`, subquery variable scoping, when to use subqueries vs declarative `@Resolver` fragments

- **Example**: A field resolver that fetches data from the Query root at runtime; a mutation resolver that calls another mutation via `ctx.mutation()`

- **Why it matters**: Enables resolvers to fetch related data that isn't known at query planning time

### Key Concepts Across These Examples

#### The `@resolver` Directive

```graphql
directive @resolver on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT
```

This tells Viaduct "generate a resolver for this". Different placements create different resolver types:

- **On object types**: `type User @resolver` → Creates `NodeResolvers.User()` (Node Resolver)

- **On Query fields**: `foo: String! @resolver` → Creates `QueryResolvers.Foo()`

- **On object fields**: `fullName: String! @resolver` → Creates `UserResolvers.FullName()`

#### Resolver Types

| Resolver Type             | Purpose                          | Generated Class              | When to Use                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Node Resolver**         | Create/fetch objects by GlobalID | `NodeResolvers.TypeName()`   | Objects that implement `Node` interface     |
| **Query Field Resolver**  | Handle root query fields         | `QueryResolvers.FieldName()` | Top-level API entry points                  |
| **Object Field Resolver** | Compute derived fields           | `TypeResolvers.FieldName()`  | Fields that need parent data or computation |

#### The GlobalID System

Viaduct's built-in global object identification:

- **Encodes**: Object type + internal ID into a single string

- **Type-safe**: Can't accidentally use wrong ID for wrong type

- **Utilities**: `ctx.globalIDFor()` to create, `ctx.ref()` to resolve

- **Standard**: Follows Relay specification for global object identification

#### Field Resolver Data Access

Field resolvers can access parent object data:

```kotlin
@Resolver(objectValueFragment = "fragment _ on User { firstname lastname }")
```

- Tells Viaduct exactly what parent data your resolver needs

- Framework automatically fetches required fields

- Available via type-safe `ctx.getObjectValue().getFirstNameOrThrow()`
