# Gradle Build Architecture

Viaduct's Gradle build is organized as a **composite build** — a set of independently viable included builds coordinated by a thin root project.

## Design Objectives

- **Encapsulate the development inner loop.** Most contributors work on engine, tenant, service, or shared code. The build should let them run tests on that code without waiting on plugin publishing, publication wiring, or demoapp configuration.

- **Verify publication correctness.** Publication is fragile — a project can compile fine under composite source substitution but produce broken published artifacts. Demoapps are real consumers of Viaduct's plugins and libraries, so the canonical way to catch downstream breakage is to run them standalone against actual published artifacts, exercising the same dependency graph an external consumer would see. This is what root `check` and CI run (`demoappsStandaloneTest`), not composite source substitution.

- **Decouple internal module structure from the public API surface.** External consumers should depend on a small set of stable coordinates. Internal modules should be free to split, merge, or reorganize without breaking downstream builds.

- **Eliminate manual dependency wiring.** Gradle's composite auto-substitution should handle the mapping from Maven coordinates to local source. No hand-maintained substitution rules.

- **Keep each build independently viable.** `core`, `gradle-plugins`, and `publications` should each be able to build and test on their own, so that changes to one build's configuration don't break another.

## The Root Project

The root `build.gradle.kts` owns no source code. It applies the `buildroot.orchestration` plugin, which creates lifecycle tasks (`check`, `test`, `build`, `detekt`, `ktlintCheck`, `spotlessCheck`, etc.) that delegate into the **participating included builds**: `core`, `gradle-plugins`, and `publications`. When you run `./gradlew check` at the root, Gradle fans out into those three builds.

Demoapps are not part of this composite build. `check` runs them by shelling out to a standalone build per demoapp via the `demoappsStandaloneTest` task — see demoapps/AGENTS.md.

## The `core` Build

`core` contains the engine, tenant API, service layer, and shared libraries — the code that most contributors work on day-to-day. Making `core` its own included build means a developer can run `./gradlew -p core test` and get a focused, fast inner loop. Gradle-plugin publishing, publication wiring, demoapp configuration, and documentation are all pushed out of this critical path.

`core` assigns **path-based Maven groups** at settings time so that composite auto-substitution registers the correct coordinates for each project. For example, projects under `core/tenant/` get group `com.airbnb.viaduct.tenant`, so `:tenant:api` publishes as `com.airbnb.viaduct.tenant:api`. This means each project's Gradle name matches its directory name — no need for synthetic project names to avoid collisions.

`core` also hosts JaCoCo aggregation and coverage thresholds, keeping CI verification commands scoped: `./gradlew -p core jacocoTestCoverageVerification`.

## Maven Coordinate Scheme

The build uses a two-tier Maven group structure:

- **`com.airbnb.viaduct`** (base group) — the public-facing artifacts that external consumers should depend on. These are the shadow jars produced by the `publications/` build: `api`, `buildtime`, `runtime`, `test-fixtures`, the `javaapi-*` Java tenant facades, and the Gradle plugins. These are the only coordinates that appear in a consumer's `build.gradle.kts`.

- **`com.airbnb.viaduct.<subgroup>`** (e.g., `com.airbnb.viaduct.tenant`, `com.airbnb.viaduct.engine`, `com.airbnb.viaduct.service`, `com.airbnb.viaduct.shared`) — the fine-grained module coordinates from `core/`. These are internal to the build. External consumers never reference them directly; they are pulled in transitively through the publication facade artifacts.

This separation means `core` modules can freely split, merge, or reorganize without affecting the coordinates that external consumers depend on.

## The `publications` Build

The `publications` build produces the public-facing `com.airbnb.viaduct` artifacts — `api`, `buildtime`, `runtime`, `test-fixtures`, and the `javaapi-*` Java tenant facades. These are facade modules whose primary job is to re-export the right set of `core` dependencies as shadow jars under stable, documented coordinates. External consumers depend on these and only these.

As an included build, `publications` participates in Gradle's automatic dependency substitution. When any other build in the composite declares a dependency on `com.airbnb.viaduct:api`, Gradle substitutes the local `publications/api` project. This eliminates manually maintained substitution rules.

## The `gradle-plugins` Build

`gradle-plugins` contains the Viaduct application and module Gradle plugins used by application developers. It depends on select `core` libraries (e.g., `shared:graphql`, `shared:viaductschema`) which are resolved via composite auto-substitution during development and via Maven coordinates when published.

It also includes `publications` solely so that `module`'s build can resolve the fat jars and sync them into `module/build/test-fixture-repo` for its TestKit tests. The generated fixture projects read that directory through a `flatDir` repository, so a nested TestKit daemon never owns `publications/*/build`.

## The `build-logic` Build

`build-logic` is a special included build that provides precompiled script plugins (build conventions) used across all other builds. It defines conventions for Kotlin static analysis (detekt and ktlint), Java static analysis (Error Prone, NullAway, and Google Java Format), publishing, JaCoCo, and Dokka documentation. Every other `settings.gradle.kts` includes `build-logic` via `pluginManagement { includeBuild("../build-logic") }`.

## Demoapps

Demoapps are not included in the root composite build. Each demoapp is its own standalone Gradle build that resolves Viaduct from published artifacts (Maven Local or Maven Central), exercising the exact dependency graph a real external consumer would see.

Root `check` and CI run all demoapps sequentially via the `demoappsStandaloneTest` task, which publishes Viaduct to a fresh, isolated Maven local repository and then runs each demoapp's own build against it. See demoapps/AGENTS.md for how to run this locally, including how to test a single demoapp during iteration.

`gradle.parent`-based mode-switching (`settings.gradle.kts` in each demoapp still has a `pluginManagement` branch for `gradle.parent != null`) is now only exercised by the separate, self-contained composite in `core/x/remoteresolvers`, which includes `demoapps/starwars` directly.
